{- | The central database. The product type contains all values and is parameterised by @datastore@. The @datastore@ can be the layer
dealing with storage. When it is @Identity@, it just means the data is stored as is. It can, however, also be an `STM.TVar` if the datastore is to be
STM based. 

Additionally, we want to parameterise over a @runtime@ type parameter. This is a container type of the database.

{- | Provides us with the ability to constrain on a larger product-type (the @runtime@) to contain, in some form or another, a value
of the `StmDb`, which can be accessed from the @runtime@.

This solves cyclic imports, without caring about the concrete @runtime@ types, we can just rely on the constraints.

{- | We want to represent our `StmDb` as an interactive state; and allow modifications of users and todos
it currently contains, for example. 

Some notes:

1. Modifications are pretty easy; we just enclose each value's DBUpdate's as necessary. 

2. We'd like to visualise either the users in the system, or the todo-lists, or everything.

3. For modification constraints, since we'd manifest STM operations into `IO`; we'd like to constrain on being able to
lift `IO` ops. to some arbitrary `m`
