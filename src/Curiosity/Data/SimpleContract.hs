Module: Curiosity.Data.SimpleContract
Description: Simple contract (also called 3in1) related datatypes

This module contains data types used to represent simple contracts, both as
used when filling a form, and used as proper validated data.

See also the [related documentation page](/documentation/objects/invoices).

-- $formDataTypes
--
-- A contract form, as displayed on a web page, is made of multiple input
-- groups (or panels, or even of separate pages). Different data types are
-- provided to represent those sets of input fields.

-- | This represents a form being filled in. In particular, it can represent
-- invalid inputs. As it is filled, it is kept in a Map in "Curiosity.Data",
-- where it is identified by a key. The form data are validated when they are
-- "submitted", using the `SubmitContract` data type below, and the key.
