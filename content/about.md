# About

Curiosity is a prototype system to think, discuss, and communicate the future
of Smart Belgium's developments. A running instance of Curiosity is made
available at [`smartcoop.sh`](//smartcoop.sh) for demonstration purpose.

## Open source

Curiosity is an open source project and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hypered/curiosity).

## Experimental

Curiosity is being developed to inform further developments, and is not
intended to be a production system. It will evolve during the next few months
as we try to nail down as precisely as possible what the best solution for
Smart Beligum is.
