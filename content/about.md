# About

Curiosity is an ever-evolving prototype system to think, discuss, and
communicate the future of Smart Coop's developments. It is exposed to
end-users as a web application and a running instance of Curiosity is made
available at [`smartcoop.sh`](//smartcoop.sh) for demonstration purpose. For
tech savvy users, the complete system is packaged as a [virtual machine
image](/documentation/machine), made to be easily run and explored.

## Experimental

Curiosity is being developed to inform further developments, and is not
intended to be a production system. It will evolve during the next few months
as we try to nail down as precisely as possible what the best solutions for
Smart Coop are.

## Open source

Curiosity is an open source project distributed under a 2-clause BSD license.
It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hypered/curiosity).

## Documented

To achieve our goals in making Curiosity a central place to inform future
developments, the complete documentation is part of the virtual machine image.
The documentation is comprised of HTML pages, visible at
[`smartcoop.sh`](//smartcoop.sh/documentation), and [man
pages](/documentation/man-pages), available from the terminal within the
virtual machine.
