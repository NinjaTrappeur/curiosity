# UBL

UBL (Universal Business Language) is a standard to represent business documents
in XML. In December 2021, an alternative representation using JSON [has been
announced](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/ubl/202112/msg00010.html).

When appropriate, example data living at `/data/<filename>` can be viewed as
UBL using a URL of the form `/ubl/<schema>/<filename>`.

For instance [`/data/one.json`](/data/one.json) can be viewed as a
`PartyLegalEntity` at
[`/ubl/PartyLegalEntity/one.json`](/ubl/PartyLegalEntity/one.json).
