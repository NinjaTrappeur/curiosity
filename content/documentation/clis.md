# Command-line interfaces

Curiosity is mainly a web application, `cty serve`, but it also comes with
additional CLIs (command-line interfaces).

The documentation for these CLIs is available as [man
pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), and the man pages are also
rendered as HTML pages:

- [`curiosity(7)`](/documentation/clis/curiosity.7)
- [`cty(1)`](/documentation/clis/cty.1)
