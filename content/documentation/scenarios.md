# Test scenarios

One the main goal of Curiosity is to precisely describe its behavior in terms
of test scenarios. To do so, Curiosity supports running scripts: they are
textual sequences of commands that mimic closly what can be done through the
web interface.

As part of its test suite, a collection of scenarios are run and their results
are compared to known sources of truth, called "golden files". This makes sure
that, as scenarios are created, and as Curiosity evolves, the system continues
to work as expected, and few bugs can be introduced inadvertantly.

# Example data

Entering enough data into the system to allow to execute (possibly manually,
through the web interface) a specific test scenario can be tedious if the
system is initially empty. Fortunately, scripts can also be used to generate
the necessary data and set the system state as desired.

A specific set of example data is available with Curiosity, called `state-0`.
(We envision that additional set of data could be created in the future.)

Note: if you are operating Curiosity yourself, you can initialize Curiosity's
state by running `cty run scenarios/state-0.txt`.

# `state-0`

We intend `state-0` to serve as common knowledge among the team working with
Curiosity. Here, we detail what it is comprised of.

Note: sometimes, we provide links to specific pages of the web application.
When those pages are displaying the live application state, it is possible that
the underlying data have changed and are no longer how they were when the
system was initialized.
